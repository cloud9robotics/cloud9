Cloud9’s ethos surrounds accessibility and spans beyond the team itself and into the real world. Our outreach team works hard to reach out the our community, whether that be to schools, local businesses, or even individuals. Through events, fundraising, and interpersonal connections, Cloud9 brings knowledge and real impact to our community. Additionally, our outreach team has stepped into the world of social media (Instagram and TikTok) to further shine a light on robotics and FTC! We’ve amassed hundreds of followers on each of our platforms, and we’re growing every day. 
It takes a lot of funding and resources to support an FTC team, and since Cloud9 aims to keep our team accessible to everyone, we have to do a lot of fundraising. During our first season, the outreach team raised over $3000 through our GoFundMe; we hope to greatly increase that number in years to come.
