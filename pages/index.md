## We make robots

We are the Cloud9 Robotics team. We operate under the Brookline Robotics Initiative, a 501 (c) nonprofit dedicated to expanding the impact that robotics can have on our youth and local communities. 

There are currently 4 FTC teams under the BRI umbrella: the Brookline Bots, an all-girls, internationally competitive team; TNT, a co-ed team in their second season, committed to making it to Worlds; The Firecrackers, the "JV" team to TNT, where team members cultivate the skills they need to level up to TNT; and us: Cloud9. 

Cloud9 brings something different, and yet very necessary, to the BRI community. We offer a space where people with other commitments and interests, whether they are a priority over robotics or not, are able to gain from the FTC experience what every other BRI team gains as well. Team members are able to build technical skills and progress their understanding of the engineering process, all while learning to work under a budget and foster effective collaboration. In short, we place a heavy emphasis on the *skills* that FTC aims to leave its participants with.

###### 
What is FTC?

We are participants in the FIRST Robotics Competition, a global competition that challenges high school students to build and program robots to compete in a tournament that changes every year. Beyond just the obvious building and programming aspects of the team, team members have to learn how to project manage, create impact through outreach, and fundraise to support their team and the parts they want (or need) to buy. 

This year, the theme is Decode (the idea being that the game is slightly archaeology themed). Our objective is to launch green and purple wiffle balls into our appropriate basket in a certain order - called a "motif" - that is determined at the beginning of each game. There are lots of caveats and nuances to this year's game, so if you are at all interested in learning more, check out this year's season kickoff video [here](https://youtu.be/tRlcAwgMx5Q).

## Robots make us

Through BRI's summer outreach program, this year in collaboration with Penguin Coding School and RoboHub, we introduce elementary and middle school students to the world of robotics. We teach them how to build and program robots, and we help them to develop the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. Through this summer program, many of our team members are hired for the first time, and get to have that positive first job expereince that we all hope for.
