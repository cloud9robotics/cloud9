Cloud9 has been working hard on each aspect of the FTC process! Here are the details:

**Build Team:**

Their primary focus right now is on solidifying the intake and outtake system. We have separate intake and outtake teams; we used to have a drive train team, but they’ve dispersed into the intake and outtake teams as the chassis has been successfully arranged. 

Intake has been doing a lot of CADing, while Outtake has primarily been working with the physical parts. That’s not to say Outtake hasn’t been working with modelling – Elana (Co-Capt.) has CADed and printed an awesome flywheel. David Kim (Build Lead) says, “We’ve really just been putting in the work, you know.”

**Programming Team:**

Headed by our prodigal 10th grader, Cooke, the Programming Team has made great efforts to both understand and implement Android Studio, as well as figure out the critical yet elusive AprilTags.

**Outreach:**

Joseph Park and Kai Putney have been absolutely dialed in on planning door-to-door fundraising and creating our flyers. Also, they’ve gotten responses from ACE Hardware – we’ll update you guys when we know more!
