Absolute ultimate tictactoe *frenzy* today. We got to know some new recruits and learned about everyone's top pick for Greatest Movie of All Time (some contenders were: Fight Club, The Hobbit, Back to the Future, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (a real feel-good-film!), and Ice Age)
After getting to know everyone a little more, we had everyone who didn't have a GibHub account go ahead and get set up, and introduced them to the Cloud9 repository. They learned how to create a new blog post on our website (that you see here), and commit and push the changes that they made.
While the captains interviewed some new applicants, our build lead out everyone talking about potential drive train designs for next year, keeping the theme of archeology in mind.
