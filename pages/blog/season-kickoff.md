Last weekend was the FTC kickoff! Cloud9 and the other [BRI](https://www.brooklinerobotics.org/) teams came together for the [reveal of the FTC Decode Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRlcAwgMx5Q). After watching the challenges, teams split up to begin brainstorming designs and discussing this year's challenge. Cloud9 came up with a few designs, with our most well-loved idea being using a flywheel as our outtake system.

Aside from technical brainstorming, the kickoff served as a chance for the teams to get to know each other! Cloud9, [BBots](https://brooklinebots.org/), [TNT](https://brooklinetnt.carrd.co/), and Firecrackers will all be spending more time socializing and picking each other's brains in the next few months.


Remember everyone, don't forget to KISS ðŸ˜˜
