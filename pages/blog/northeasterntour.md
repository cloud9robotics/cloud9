On Wednesday, May 21, all of the BRI teams were invited by Northeastern Robotics to tour their engineering labs. They walked us through their engineering process and showed us a couple of their recent projects, including their underwater robot and some of their drones. We are incredibly grateful for this experience and we extend a big thank you to Northeastern Robotics for hosting us!
