Recently in our past few meetings, we've been working on developing our drivetrain and outtake system. During this process, we worked with cardboard to model our first draft of our output and then continued our work on Fusion 360. During the making of our drivetrain, we realized that we needed some more parts and ended up getting a whole new kit as well as organizational bins.  We spent a lot of time putting all of our parts into different sections and finally getting everything organized.
