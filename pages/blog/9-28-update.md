Hi everyone!

We have a few updates from the Cloud9 team! First and foremost, we’ve implemented a new custom to our meetings: intros and outros! These sections of our meetings are meant to make sure everyone is up-to-date on the happenings of the team, check in on progress on individual to-dos, and ensure everyone knows their tasks for next week’s meeting! We’ll let you all know if and how these intros/outros help!

Also, we are upgrading our organization! We now have a portable case/drawer/organizational system! Elana, Julian, and Kai are organizing it as we speak!

We received our shipment from REV; our drive-train team now has all the parts they need to start the chassis!

We have a lot to do before our first qualifier, so we’re going to get to work!
